📡 M5Stack Cardputer Wi-Fi Hotspot

Transform your M5Stack into a simulated public Wi-Fi hotspot with custom authentication and data logging!
This project demonstrates how to create a public hotspot using the M5Stack Cardputer. It simulates a Wi-Fi network and serves a custom web page hosted on an SD card. User-submitted data is stored locally on the SD card, offering complete control and privacy for testing and educational purposes.
Ideal for educational applications and IoT projects, the system combines efficient hardware with a simple and functional interface.
